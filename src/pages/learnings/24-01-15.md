Problem :
Say your device storage limit reaches often & you need to move large media files from various devices (Iphone, Ipad, Mac) to some cloud storage.

In my case, i'll be uploading to google drive since i have subscribed to google one plan (say 1TB), vastly different from icloud's 5GB.

Step 1:
Move all photos/videos from your Iphone device to Macbook photos app.
- How to import ? [check here]()

Once importing is done.
You cannot directly uploaded the imported files from your macbook machine to google photos.
In my case, i wanted to upload photos by sorting them in a year-to-year folders.
But If you check photos library, it has a different way of storing for performance, thats how Photos app work.

<img src="/images/photos-library-storage.png"  width="600" height="400" />

It will be really easy to upload these A,B,C,D... folders to cloud storage but those will become meaningless, you wont be able to meaningfully explore those files.

So lets create some albums with the help of smart album in photos app.
Once albums are created. We will be able to extract them to location & that file/folder location will have some meaning full names(2024/2023/2022) inside it which will help us.

On Albums menu item, click on smart album.

<img src="/images/smart-album.png"  width="300" height="400" />

Here, you have all of the metadata about your photos & videos.

In this case, I am using `Date Captured` field in the given range to create album of 465 items.

<img src="/images/smart-album-example.png"  width="700" height="200" />

I repeat this step of creating smart albums.
Once done, under my albums menu, you will see your albums.

Now, lets create uploadable folders for these albums by running the following apple script.

This scripts lets you select your albums & move the items in those selected albums in the provided destination path.

```
set dest to "/Users/photos-bkp" as POSIX file as text -- the destination folder (use a valid path) 

tell application "Photos"
	
	activate
	
	set l to name of albums
	
	set albNames to choose from list l with prompt "Select some albums" with multiple selections allowed
	
	
	
	if albNames is not false then -- not cancelled  
		
		repeat with tName in albNames
			
			set tFolder to dest & tName
			
			my makeFolder(tFolder) -- create a folder named (the name of this album) in dest   
			
			export (get media items of album tName) to (tFolder as alias) without using originals
			
		end repeat
		
	end if
	
end tell

on makeFolder(tPath)
	
	do shell script "mkdir -p " & quoted form of POSIX path of tPath
	
end makeFolder
```
