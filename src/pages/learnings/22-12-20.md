title: 'Making frontend docker image environment agnostic'

### Goal : to have less number of docker image, ideally a single image for an applcation

a simple application has 2 components

### Backend part

- todos application
    GET /todos

the backend server is started by running
> node server.js --config config.yaml

config.yaml

```yaml
db:
  name: abcd
  region: asia / us / uk ${ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_COMING_FROM_K8S_CLUSTER_CONFIG_MAP}
  password: ${ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_COMING_FROM_K8S_CLUSTER_SECRET} # <-- secret
  user: abcd@asia
```

lets say we have three environments in each region

- todos.asia.com
- todos-uat.asia.com
- todos-dev.asia.com
.
.
.
you get the picture..

we provide same docker image which has placeholders in the config.yaml file, values are populated at runtime (jvm/node/python).

### Frontend part

- it has three main static assets which needs to be served.
  - html
  - css
  - javascript

```javascript
const App = async () => {
  const backendUrl = 'todos-dev.asia.com'
  const todos = await (await fetch(`${backendUrl}/todos`, {method: 'GET'})).json()

  return <ul>{todos.map(todo => <li> ${todo.name} </li>)}</ul>
}
```

Lets build artifacts to deploy them in kubernetes.

After building frontend `yarn build` or `npm build`, a build tool will do optimizations  to improve performance like minification/ dead-code elimination/uglifying , many more things as per business requirement.

the artifacts are static & they are meant to served as static files/ resources/assets (html/css/js/woff/png/gif) to the clients( usally browser).
unlike jars/python file (Server artifacts) which requires compute for running them.

frontend artifacts will be getting executed at client side in someone's browser

since these artifacts will be running in client side, we need to somehow send information to client side about which server it needs to hit.

### option 1: use environment variable

when you run `npm build`, you can pass the environment BACKEND_BASEURL = 'todos-uat.asia.com'

```typescript
const App = async () => {
  // const backendUrl = 'todos-uat.asia.com'
  const backendUrl = process.env.BACKEND_BASEURL // process is only available in node environment. i.e only while running build command
  
  const posts = await (await fetch(`${backendUrl}/todos`, {method: 'GET'})).json()
  return posts.map(post => <div> post.name </div>)
}
```

**Distribution folder**


```directory
.
+-- /public
+--+-- manifest.json
+--+-- favicon.png
+-- /assets
+--+-- *.js
+--+-- *.css
+-- index.html
```

</detail>
</summary>

Drawback of this approach is that you will have to run `npm build` 9 times, -> those many docker artifacts.

### Option 2: dynamically populate the environment variable

```typescript
const App = async () => {
  // const backendUrl = 'todos-uat.asia.com'
  const response = await fetch('/env.json') // this client call will ask for public/env.json asset from the server.
  const backendUrl = response.backendUrl
  const posts = await (await fetch(`${backendUrl}/todos`, {method: 'GET'})).json()
  return posts.map(post => <div> post.name </div>)
}
```

env.json looks like this

```json
{
  "backendUrl": "todos-uat.asia.com"
}
```

now when we build

** Distribution folder**

```directory
.
+-- /public
+--+-- manifest.json
+--+-- env.json
+--+-- favicon.png
+-- /assets
+--+-- *.js
+--+-- *.css
+-- index.html
```

### Points to note

- we are now making use of browser runtime to fetch the backend url. it is no more hardcoded at build time.

- we have not solved the problem yet, env.json is still a static asset which needs to have correct endpoint value before it gets served/deployed.

- now we have to make use of docker runtime, which is the intermediate step between build time & runtime.
- this is where we do the magic

- generally we use nginx to serve our frontend assets.

- this is the path where our distribution folder will be copied in nginx server/pod.

> /usr/share/nginx/html/

Docker file looks like

```dockerfile
FROM node:current as build

WORKDIR /src

COPY package.json /src

RUN npm install

COPY . /src

RUN npm run build


FROM nginx:alpine

RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*
COPY --from=build /dist /usr/share/nginx/html/
COPY /nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
COPY /substitute-env-and-start-nginx.sh /

CMD ['./substitute-env-and-start-nginx.sh']
```

magic shell file lets name it `substitute-env-and-start-nginx.sh`.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh

: "${BACKEND_BASEURL}" # ensure BACKEND_BASEURL exists and exit otherwise

cat <<EOF > /usr/share/nginx/html/env.json
{
  "backendUrl": "${BACKEND_BASEURL}"
}
EOF

# start server
nginx -g 'daemon off;'
```

> docker build -t frontend-image:0.1.0 .


kubectl login  to asia-dev cluster

```yaml
...
...
configmap:
  BACKEND_BASEURL: "<this value will be picked up by the sh file>"
...
...  
```

kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml

```yaml
...
...
image: frontend-image:0.1.0
...
...
```

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

this image is now environment agnostic, you just need to have configmap populated in each of your kubenetes clusters.
