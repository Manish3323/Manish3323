## Rote learning don't help much

Try not to mug up everything just to write long answers to get full marks.
Instead try to learn the meaning so that it stays inside our minds for long period of time.

I can't remember much what i have learnt till 10-11th class, however most of concepts/topics which i learned by understanding it correctly, i still remember them. surely i will need some brushing up my memory but it is still there in the back of my mind.

So yeah that's it.
Try not to mug up!!
